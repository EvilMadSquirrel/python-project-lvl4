Task Manager is a web application for task management, with the ability to use labels, statuses, change executors.

### Development Features:
The project is divided into separate applications for possible reuse. Each application has its own set of tests, constants, and translated strings independent of the root project.

## See my app:

[Task manager](https://evilmadsquirrel-task-manager.herokuapp.com/)

## Local installation:

```bash
pip install --user git+https://github.com/RottingHorse/python-project-lvl4
```

###### Basic usage:

The file ".env" should be created in root directory You should list there local variables:

```
SECRET_KEY='your secret here there'
```
```
ACCESS_TOKEN='token from Rollbar error tracker'
```
to install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After creation of .env file the migration should be started by two commands:

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

To launch the program:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Usually it started at address http://127.0.0.1:8000/
